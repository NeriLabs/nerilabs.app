        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>TipJar — Tip Tracker & Shift Logger</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>NeriLabs ("we," "our," or "us") built TipJar as a freemium application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use TipJar.</p>
        <p>We take your privacy seriously. TipJar is designed to keep your financial data private and under your control.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Data you enter into the app:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tip amounts and dates</li>
            <li>Shift details (clock-in/out times, hourly wages, job types, notes)</li>
            <li>Income goals (daily, weekly, monthly targets)</li>
            <li>Tip calculator inputs (bill amounts, split counts)</li>
            <li>App preferences (appearance, default job type, default hourly wage)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> All tip, shift, and earnings data is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to your financial data, and it is never uploaded to our servers.</p>

        <p><strong>Subscription information:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions. RevenueCat processes your subscription status but does not share your payment details with us. All payments are handled by Apple through the App Store.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Automatically collected data:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect analytics, usage data, crash reports, or device identifiers.</li>
            <li>We do not use any third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Your Data Is Stored</h2>
        <p>All your tip logs, shift records, earnings data, goals, and preferences are stored locally on your device using Apple's on-device storage frameworks. This data never leaves your device unless you choose to export it yourself using the CSV or PDF export feature.</p>
        <p>If you delete the app, all locally stored data will be permanently removed from your device.</p>

        <h2>Data Export</h2>
        <p>TipJar Pro includes the ability to export your earnings data as CSV or PDF files. When you use this feature, the exported file is generated on your device and shared through Apple's native share sheet. We do not receive or store any exported files.</p>

        <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>TipJar offers optional paid subscriptions ("TipJar Pro") managed through the Apple App Store. Subscription plans include weekly, monthly, and annual options.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.</li>
            <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
            <li>You can manage and cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID account settings.</li>
            <li>We use RevenueCat solely to verify your subscription status. We do not receive or store any payment or billing information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>TipJar uses the following third-party service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> — for subscription management and verification. RevenueCat's privacy policy is available at <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">revenuecat.com/privacy</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use any advertising networks, analytics platforms, or other third-party data services.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>TipJar is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to remove it.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since all your data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it at all times. You can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>View all your data within the app</li>
            <li>Edit or delete any individual tip or shift entry</li>
            <li>Export your data at any time (Pro feature)</li>
            <li>Delete all data by deleting the app</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
