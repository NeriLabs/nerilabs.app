        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p class="app-name">QuickBill: Invoice Maker by NeriLabs</p>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective date: March 1, 2026</p>

        <p>By using QuickBill, you agree to these terms. Please read them before using the app.</p>

        <h2>The Service</h2>
        <p>QuickBill is an invoice creation tool that helps freelancers and small businesses generate and send professional invoices. QuickBill is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied.</p>

        <h2>Free Tier and Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>QuickBill offers a free tier that allows you to create up to 3 invoices. To create unlimited invoices, a Pro subscription is required.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Subscriptions are billed through your Apple ID and processed by the App Store.</li>
            <li>Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the renewal date.</li>
            <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time in your device's Settings > Apple ID > Subscriptions.</li>
            <li>No refunds are provided for partial subscription periods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Data and Responsibility</h2>
        <p>You are solely responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all information you enter into QuickBill, including client details, invoice amounts, tax rates, and business information.</p>
        <p>QuickBill is an invoicing tool, not an accounting service. You should not rely on QuickBill as your sole financial record. We recommend maintaining separate accounting records and consulting with a qualified accountant for financial matters.</p>

        <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All data is stored locally on your device. QuickBill does not provide cloud backup, syncing, or data recovery services. If you delete the app, reset your device, or lose your device, your data may be permanently lost. You are responsible for maintaining your own backups.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, NeriLabs and its developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Loss of data, revenue, or business opportunities</li>
            <li>Errors in invoice calculations or generated documents</li>
            <li>Inability to access or use the app</li>
            <li>Any actions taken based on invoices generated by QuickBill</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree to use QuickBill only for lawful purposes. You may not use the app to generate fraudulent, misleading, or illegal invoices.</p>

        <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these terms from time to time. The updated terms will be posted on this page with a revised effective date. Continued use of QuickBill after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>
